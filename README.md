# SOCR - Smart Oxygen Cylinger Regulator

The amount of oxygen present inside the cylinder is measured by the pressure at the outlet nozzle. The pressure is measured using a high precision Pressure Sensor. The output of the pressure sensor is cascaded with a microcontroller to process the signal and display the pressure of oxygen cylinder. Whenever the level of oxygen is below a pre-decided value, a signal is further transmitted to the monitoring station through wireless communication module which in turn uses indoor localization which further conveys the exact location of the cylinder to give more accurate location of the oxygen cylinder in a populated hospital room and alerts the nearest attendant of the patient, so that the patient can be attended at the quickest. Graphical display is used at monitoring station to indicate the pressure in the oxygen cylinders to initiate actions like replacement of empty cylinders with filled ones.
